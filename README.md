# sentiment-alanalysis
This project focuses on performing Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text data (e.g., customer reviews, tweets, or comments) into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral, helping businesses and individuals understand public opinion and customer feedback.

*Problem Statement
Understanding customer sentiment is crucial for businesses to improve products, services, and overall customer experience. This project uses machine learning to automatically detect and classify the sentiment expressed in textual data.

*Key Features
Data collection (can be from social media, reviews, etc.)

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization)

Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings

Sentiment classification using machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Deep Learning)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Data visualization of sentiment trends

*Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

NLP libraries: NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob

Machine learning: Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras

Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit for interactive demos
